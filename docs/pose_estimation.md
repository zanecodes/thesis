# Pose Estimation Techniques

## Monocular

* Learning-based
  * Trains a model to associate 3d poses with 2d projections
  * May not be as robust as learning-free approaches
* Learning-free
  * Uses kinematic constraints to solve pose ambiguity

### Learning-based

* Regression forest models (Xu, Chi, et al)

### Learning-free

* Line-based pose estimation (Unzueta, Luis, et al)

## Depth-based
